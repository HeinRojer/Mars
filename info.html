        <h2>About Mars</h2>
        <p>
            
Mars, the fourth planet from the Sun, has long fascinated astronomers, scientists, and space enthusiasts. Known as the "Red Planet" because of its reddish appearance due to iron oxide, Mars is home to some of the most extreme landscapes in our solar system, including Olympus Mons—the tallest volcano—and Valles Marineris, a canyon system that dwarfs Earth's Grand Canyon.
